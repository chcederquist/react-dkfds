### ðŸ”§ Installing Node.js with NVM

We recommend using [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.

#### 1. Install NVM

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

Then restart your shell, or run:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
nvm --version
```

Windows:
Use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). Download the installer from the latest release and follow the instructions.

#### 2. Install the required Node.js version

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```
