Small:
Issue: strong vs. mark discussion on badges
Issue: Use of span inside buttons in tablist
Issue: Empty span on locked example and error example of stepindicator
Issue: Double-span-wrap on extra information example
Issue: Too much spacing in the code example of left menu
Issue: Radioknap legend bruger aria-labelledby med reference til legend, men det g√∏r Datofelter ikke
Issue: switchTabOnKeyPress kode er forvirrende, da der blot kan bruges modulo-operator

Medium:
Export prop types
Handle "header open" class set on <body>
Timed loading spinner - See guidelines on loading spinner, where certain timestamps change the text
Overflow menu on Header
Linting + Prettier
Error and hint into own component? (Dropdown, InputField, Datefields, Radiobuttons)
Label into own component?
Rewrite legend-props/label-props to take a simple label string
Collapse/expand-function on RadioButtons.tsx and Checkbox.tsx
Shorthand for big type names
Automate icon type generation

Big:
Storybook stories 1:1 with designsystem.dk

Footers: Provide examples or just leave it out?
